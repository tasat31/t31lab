# Kodi on Raspberry Pi
## Overviews

Kodi is a free and open source media center, operating on various platform.

Kodi comforts you with tasty digital experiences and enriches your life.

The digital experiences are provided not only in your living room, but also on the road trecking or on the board triping.
So now, we are talking about embeded platform, and focusing on OSMC@Raspberry Pi.
The user interface of OSMC is designed as frame buffer application, and end users can achieve easy accesibility.
We intend to use Kodi as a graphical front-end of IoT and AI output.

Not only processing engine or algorism, but also beautiful and tasty man-machine interface is essential towards next society.
The reason is clear, so many people, engineers and not-engineer will access the assets of IoT and AI
that user-friendly interface is inevitable. 

We think Kodi is best solution for such purpose.
