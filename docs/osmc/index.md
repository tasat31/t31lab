# OSMC on Raspberry Pi
## Overviews

OSMC is a free and open source media center, operating on Raspberry Pi.

The user interface is designed as frame buffer application, and end users can achieve easy accesibility.
We intend to use OSMC as a graphical front-end of IoT and AI output.

Not only processing engine or algorism, but also beautiful and tasty man-machine interface is essential towards next society.
The reason is clear, so many people, engineers and not-engineer will access the assets of IoT and AI
that user-friendly interface is inevitable. 

We think OSMC is best solution for such purpose.
