# SDR as Cognitive machines
## Overviews

It is our goal to develop Software Defined Radio(SDR), and to make the SDR behave as Cognitive machines.

SDR is not only for Radio Frequency, but also for replacement of hard-wired electronic device.

Similar to a human brain, AI is required to be flexible and predictable in every condition and event of actual world.
The most optimal approach is selected for resolving solutions rapidly and correctly. We think that cognitive machines is equipped with such characteristics.
By this feature, cognitive machines can select Support Vector, Convolutional Nueral Network by convolutional layer or pooling layers, of many deep learning methods.

It is nonsense for you to ask which AI methods is best. That is why you can apply all the useful methods optimally through implementing SDR as Cognitive machines.

We can do it.
