# Python and Django for IoT Solutions
## Overviews

A lot of IoT's prevailing on the Web all over the world, 
it is great deal to learn Web framework system and you can achieve:

* Rapid prototyping
* Saving developing time
* So you can start up a new project on the fly

This guide leads you to the developing life with Django and focuses on creating and manipulating the database models.
Django is Web framework, powered by Python, and provides us with tremendous flexible and useful ways how we structure our models.

Designing data structure is mentioned not only to Django, but also many other programing language, 
However it is effective for projects to know how we structure our models with Django and Django model utitilities.

I think, database relationship and serializing data is the keywords of this article.

So I will explain inlineformset and dynamically add form of inlineformset on the frontend finally, 
then discusing some approaches to IoT solutions.

Let's learn it step by step!
